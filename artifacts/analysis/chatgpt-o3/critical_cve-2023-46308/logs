Component	plotly.js JavaScript plotting library
Vulnerable code path	src/lib/index.js → expandObjectPaths()
Patched in	1.55.0 (back‑port of a guard) and fully in 2.25.2
Impact	An attacker who controls a dotted‑key object that is passed to Plotly helpers can inject properties 
        into Object.prototype → every plain object created afterwards inherits attacker‑chosen keys/values. 
        That can bypass authorization checks, tamper with logic that trusts “own” properties, or lead to RCE 
        when polluted properties are later executed as code.
Root cause	The helper recursively walks a dotted string () and does for each segment. When a segment 
        equals __proto__, the assignment is performed on the prototype chain itself, overwriting the global 
        prototype. No validation existed in ≤ 1.54.x."a.b.c"dest[prop] = value
